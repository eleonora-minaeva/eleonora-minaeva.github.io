## About Me
I am a Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Social and Political Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=eleonora-minaeva). I am working at the intersection of authoritarian governance, subnational institutions, and public attitudes in non-democratic contexts. My research combines quantitative methods, survey research, quasi-experimental designs, and qualitative interviews to examine how institutional design, elections, and elite strategies shape governance outcomes and citizens’ perceptions of political authority and legitimacy. Substantively, my work focuses on post-communist countries, with a particular emphasis on Russia and Kazakhstan.

From January to May 2025, I was a Visiting Scholar at the [Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies (IERES)](https://ieres.elliott.gwu.edu/about-us/visiting-scholars/) at George Washington University in Washington, DC. Prior to my doctoral studies, I held research and teaching positions at the European University at St. Petersburg and Perm State University. I am currently on the 2025–2026 academic job market and open to academic, policy-oriented, and applied research positions.

      Autocrats often replace elected local officials with appointed administrators, prioritizing vertical loyalty over downward accountability. Yet little is known about how citizens interpret such changes. Do local elections still shape perceptions of legitimacy when they no longer ensure meaningful representation? This study examines how Russians evaluate mayors under institutional centralization, using a nationally representative vignette experiment. I test how citizens respond to four elite cues: local embeddedness, selection mode, professional background, and leadership style. The findings show that citizens meaningfully differentiate among local officials, even in the absence of programmatic politics or real autonomy. Electoral selection and local origin significantly boost perceived trust, effectiveness, and representativeness—especially among regime skeptics and protest participants. Loyalist citizens, by contrast, tend to favor appointed, administrative, and compromise-oriented profiles. These results highlight two distinct pathways through which local elections matter: as signals of democratic inclusion for some, and as proxies for managerial competence for others.

        This study examines the introduction of local executive elections in Kazakhstan, where rural executives
        (<em>akim</em>s) were previously appointed through a centralized system. We analyze the impact of these
        elections on elite turnover and recruitment, leveraging a complete dataset of all subdistrict elections
        and a pilot study of akim biographies. Elections resulted in frequent leadership replacement. Nevertheless,
        we show that they did not result in inclusion of a broader group of local or the selection of more
        locally-embedded officials. The results suggest that elections may serve more to formalize the renewal of
        the same bureaucratic elite than to co-opt new groups or widen access to power.

        This article examines the political logic of digital surveillance deployment in contemporary authoritarian
        governance through the case of Moscow’s AI Experiment. We ask whether the expansion of facial
        recognition–enabled CCTV reflects a logic of performative legitimacy—improving policing effectiveness—or
        a logic of infrastructural political control, whereby surveillance infrastructure is expanded in response
        to protest activity. Using original spatially and temporally disaggregated data on CCTV installation,
        district-level crime clearance, and protest events in which detentions occurred, we provide the first
        systematic empirical test of these competing logics in Russia. Empirically, we combine district-level panel
        models of crime clearance before and after the 2020 rollout of facial recognition with models predicting
        the expansion of public-space CCTV. The results reveal a sharp asymmetry. Facial recognition is only weakly
        and inconsistently associated with improvements in crime clearance, and only at the aggregate level. By
        contrast, the expansion of public-space surveillance is strongly and spatially linked to recent protest
        activity, independent of crime dynamics and prior surveillance density. These findings show that digital
        surveillance in Russia is deployed less to deliver measurable policing gains than to reorganize urban space
        in ways that lower the future costs of monitoring and intervention. More broadly, the study demonstrates
        how technocratic digitalization enables authoritarian regimes to translate episodes of protest into durable
        infrastructural capacity.

    Mass Attitudes towards Russia’s Aggression against Ukraine: Tentative Support for Top-Down Opinion Formation<br>

      <em>
        This paper studies variation in mass attitudes towards the Russo-Ukrainian War. Although most Europeans
        express dismay at Russia's aggression against Ukraine, more ambivalent or even pro-Kremlin positions are
        not rare. Drawing on the literature on foreign policy and wars, we hypothesize that support for the
        aggressor may reflect a quartet of factors: economic interests, ideological preferences, political cues,
        and disinformation. We probe the role of these factors using two types of survey data. The first is an
        original survey conducted in five countries (Czechia, France, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) and spanning
        over 12,000 respondents. The other is the Solidarity in Europe survey with more than 24,000 respondents from
        seventeen countries. The results of three types of analyses reveal that neutral and pro-Kremlin attitudes,
        held by sizeable segments of European society, are most strongly linked to the positions of respondents’
        preferred political parties, followed by disinformation and ideology. Overall, top-down models of public
        opinion seem to explain better within-country variations in attitudes towards the conflict than bottom-up
        models. These findings, which should be interpreted carefully, carry important implications for containing
        Russia's influence over Europe's public opinion and contribute to the literature on public preference
        formation in the field of foreign policy.

([Project link](https://alameda.institute/research/maidan-revolutions/))

I am a researcher in the international project *Maidan Revolutions, the War in Ukraine, and Civil Society Responses*, which examines the social and political consequences of revolutions and war in post-Soviet societies. Within the project, I am responsible for the design and implementation of cross-national survey research in Armenia, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. My work includes developing research questions and hypotheses, designing questionnaires, coordinating with survey firms and reviewing pilot studies, analyzing survey data, and contributing empirical findings to academic publications.

**GLOBAL — European Governance and Politics Programme (ERC Advanced Grant)**  
([Project link](https://europeangovernanceandpolitics.eui.eu/global/))

I am an associated researcher in *GLOBAL*, an ERC Advanced Grant project led by Daniele Caramani at the European University Institute. My contribution focuses on data collection and validation for research on global party networks and transnational political organizations. I work on collecting and systematizing data on party memberships and transnational party-linked NGOs, creating benchmark datasets for evaluating large language models, and validating generative AI outputs to construct high-quality datasets for the analysis of global political cleavages.
