## Current Projects
I specialize in comparative studies of authoritarian regimes, with a focus on the politics of post-communist countries. My research projects investigate local politics, urban protests, and interethnic relations in non-democratic systems. My current dissertation projects examine how dictators manipulate subnational institutions, specifically addressing two key questions: Why do authoritarian regimes decentralize? And if already decentralized, why do they reverse it? This study analyzes the factors that predict the introduction and cancellation of public elections at the subnational level across autocratic regimes worldwide.

The second part of my project explores the impact of introducing local executive elections on local contestation, elite composition, and government performance. This collaborative research is conducted with [Kirill Melnikov](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=kirill-melnikov) and [Thomas Hazell](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/thomas-hazell). We explore a unique experimental setting in Kazakhstan, where local executive elections have been introduced, and we track the changes in the composition and compliance of rural elites.

## Teaching Experience
Last year, I taught the **Introduction to R** course for first-year PhD students at the European University Institute. This fall, I am conducting a [block seminar on the Political Paths of Post-Soviet Countries](https://www.tucan.tu-darmstadt.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000002,-N000036,-N0,-N390726302531940,-N390726302579941,-N0,-N0,-N0) for Master’s students at the Technical University of Darmstadt.
