## About Me
I am a Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Social and Political Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=eleonora-minaeva). In the Fall Semester of 2025, I am also teaching at the Department of History and Social Sciences at the Technical University of Darmstadt. From January to May 2025, I was a Visiting Scholar at the [Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies (IERES)](https://ieres.elliott.gwu.edu/about-us/visiting-scholars/) at George Washington University in Washington, DC.

## Research
I specialize in comparative studies of authoritarian regimes, with a focus on the politics of post-communist countries. My current dissertation projects examine how dictators manipulate subnational institutions, specifically addressing two key questions: **Why do authoritarian regimes decentralize? And if already decentralized, why do they reverse it?** This study analyzes the factors that predict the introduction and cancellation of public elections at the subnational level across autocratic regimes worldwide.

The second part of my dissertation explores the impact of introducing local executive elections on local contestation, elite composition, and government performance. This collaborative research is conducted with [Kirill Melnikov](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=kirill-melnikov) and [Thomas Hazell](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/thomas-hazell). We examine a unique experimental setting in **Kazakhstan**, where local executive elections have been introduced, and we track the changes in the composition and compliance of rural elites.

My previous research interests included contentious politics across regime types. In particular, I focused on urban protests and grassroots mobilization around urban planning and housing issues in major Russian cities. Some of this work contributed to broader collaborative projects on collective action, such as *[TRIPAR](https://triparblog.wordpress.com)* and *[Varieties of Russian Activism: State-Society Contestation in Everyday Life](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv37scft2)*.

I have also worked on interethnic relations in non-democratic systems. In this context, I studied how the spatial concentration of ethnic groups shapes institutionalized power-sharing arrangements and the political autonomy of ethnic groups. I developed a measure of spatial localization as an alternative to conventional fractionalization and polarization indices. This research was part of the project *[Ethnic Regional Autonomies](http://identityworld.ru/shop)*.

## Teaching Experience
In 2023, I taught the [Introduction to R](https://github.com/eminaeva/IntroR) course for first-year PhD students at the European University Institute. In the fall of 2024, I conducted a [block seminar on the Political Paths of Post-Soviet Countries](https://www.tucan.tu-darmstadt.de/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=CampusNet&PRGNAME=COURSEDETAILS&ARGUMENTS=-N000000000000002,-N000036,-N0,-N390726302531940,-N390726302579941,-N0,-N0,-N0) for Master’s students of Governance and Public Policy, Data and Discourse Studies, Political Theory at the Technical University of Darmstadt ([Download Syllabus](Syllabus2025-2.pdf)).
